Simple phone number encoder written in Ruby

Usage:

  ruby numbers.rb <dictionary> <numbers>

  <dictionary> - dictionary file, which contains possible words to be used during encoding
  <numbers>    - files containing list of phone numbers to encode

Note:

Dictionary is assumed to be in lowercase. No case-insensitivity was made. Just a test :)
